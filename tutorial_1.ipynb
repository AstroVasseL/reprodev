In this tutorial, we will set up the project structure and fill the documents and create a reproduvible research compendium. The structure of this compendium is based on [these workshop materials](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/workshop-materials.html). In [the second tutorial](tutorial_2.html), we will publish the compendium and create a reproducible website with `Quarto`.\n",
