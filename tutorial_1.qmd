We are going to use the `Quarto` package to create a reproducible research compendium. 

# Tutorial materials
The tutorial materials consist of a project structure and dummy scripts that we will use, fill and publish (in [the second tutorial](_site/tutorial_2.html)). 

1. Right-click on the following link and select _Save Link As..._: [my-reproducible-manuscript.zip](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/workshop-reproducible-manuscripts/raw/main/my-reproducible-manuscript.zip)
2. Save the zip file in a location that you can easily access. We recommend to **not** use the default download location of your browser.
3. Extract the contents of the zipped file.

The materials should look like this:

```
